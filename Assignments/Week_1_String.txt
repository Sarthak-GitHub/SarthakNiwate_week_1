1. What is string 

2.Define multiline string mentioned below and print it 

"Yeah, you can be the greatest, you can be the best
You can be the King Kong bangin' on your chest
You can beat the world, you can beat the war
You can talk to God, go bangin' on his door"


3. WAP to access and print characters from string "Lakshya toh har haal mein paana hai" usin index

4. WAP to access and print characters from string "Lakshya toh har haal mein paana hai" usin slice

5. Short not on behaviour of slice 

6. str = "abrakadabra"
What will be the output of below 
	str[1:6:20]
	str[::1]
	str[::-1]
	str[3:7:-1]
	str[7:4:-1]
	str[0:10000:1]
	str[-4:1:-1]
	str[-4:1:-2]
	str[5:0:1]
	str[9:0:0]
	str[0:-10:-1]
	str[0:0:1]
	str[0:-9:-2]
	str[-5:-9--2]
	str[10:-1:-1]
	str[1000:2:1]

7. WAP to access each character from string in forward and backword direction 

8. Use String functions: Calculate length of string "allhailkingkong"

9. Use String functions: WAP to print true if string "bla" is present in the string "hestarted blabbering"

10. Use String functions: Compare two strings using arithmatic operators
str1 = "abc"
str2 = "abc"
str3 = "abcd"
str4 = "random"

Check which strings equality using ==, !=, <, <=, >, >= and print the message in formate <first string> operator name <second string>
Ex. str1 is equal to str2

11. Use String functions: Remove spaces from string
str1 = "abc def "
str2 = "   bla bla bla"
str3 = "bla bla baar "
12. WAP to find substring in forward direction using find() and index()
str1 = "demo"
str2 = "the python demo is scheduled"

13. WAP to find substring in backword direction using rfind() and rindex()
str1 = "demo"
str2 = "the python demo is scheduled"

14. WAP to display all positions of substing in given string
str1 = "ababadbabdfabefbabab"
str2 = "ab"

15. Use String functions: Count substring in given string 
str1 = "ababadbabdfabefbabab"
str2 = "ab"

16. Use String functions: Replace string with other sting : Correct the spelling of str1 using str2
str1 = "pixyzpple"
str2 = "nea"

Provide explanation on replace string functionality. How can we change the content by using replace if strings are immutable.

17. Use String functions: WAP to split the string "Chistats pvt ltd"

18. Use String functions: WAP to join the strings "Chistats", "pvt", "ltd". Join with "_"

19. WAP to change the case of the string to Uppercase and lowercase, str : "CHisTats pVT LtD"

20. WAP to print true if given string starts with "Chistats" and ends with "pune"
str1 = "Chistats pvt ltd"

21. WAP to check type of characters prsent in the string. Apply functins : isalnum(), isalphs(), isdigit(), islower(), isupper(), istitle(), isspace()
str1 = "wc2011"
str2 = "WORLDCUP"
str3 = "2011"
str4 = "world cup 2011"
str5 = "worldcup"
str6 = " "

22. Formatting the string 
name = "Chistats"
year = "2017"
age = "4"
Use below formats to print the statement as "Chistats is established in the 2017 and today we are celebrating 4th birthday"
	1. {} {} {}
	2. {0} {1} {2}
	3. {name} {year} {age}
	
23. WAP to print the reverse order of words from statement "Chistats is established in the 2017 and today we are celebrating 4th birthday"

24. WAP to print the reverse interna content of each word from statement "Chistats is established in the 2017 and today we are celebrating 4th birthday"

25. WAPTP characters from odd position in one lineand even positions in second line

26. Merge two string as given below
str1 = "citt"
str2 = "hsas"
chistats

27. WAP to sort characters of string, first alphabets symbols followed by numeric valuesEx
str1 = "Q9W3E81"
Output will be EQW1389

28. WAP to print the character number of time given in the strings next index
Ex: a5b2c3
output will be : aaaaabbccc

29. WAP to print the nth alphabet from given char in the string 
Ex. a4k3b2
Output will be : aeknbd

30. WAP to remove duplicat characters from given string 

31. WAP to print number of occurances of characted in the gven string 

32. WAP to format the numbers in print statement 
	format decimal 123
	format floating number 123.4567
	format binary number 153
	format octal numner 153
	format hexa decimal (lower case) 143
	format hexa decimal (Upper case) 143
	format int and float with sign : + and -
	
33. WAP to align number 123 in print statemen as below
	123
	12300
	123000
	000123
	-123
	12.3
	-12.3

34. WAP to truncate string using format method,
input : ""chistats
output : chi

Note use all formatters 
	.
	>
	<
	*<
	
35. Dynamic float format template
num = "{:{align}{width}.{precision}f}"
Useabove template to print the numbe 123.236 as 123.24 using < and > operator


36. Define the Usage of strip() and explain with the example
