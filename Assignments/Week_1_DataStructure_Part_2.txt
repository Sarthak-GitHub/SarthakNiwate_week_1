16. Given two list of Holes and Balls consisting of N and M integers respectively, denoting the diameter of holes and balls respectively. M number of balls are made to roll from A to B on a sloping surface with N holes, each having different depth.
The task is to find the eventual position of each ball in the order of the ball released considering the following:
	- A ball will fall into a hole if its diameter is less than or equal to the diameter of the hole.
	- A hole Hi will become full if i numbers of balls fall into it.
	- If a hole is full, then no more balls fall into it.
	- A ball will reach B from A, if and only if it is not falling into any one of the holes.
	- If a ball is in hole Pi, then its position is i. If a ball reached the bottom point B, then take its position as 0.
	
Explanation:
	Ball of diameter 20 will fall into the hole H1 and the hole H1 will become full.
	Balls with diameter 15, 7 and 10 will reach bottom, since the hole H1 is full and diameters of holes H2 and H3 are less than the diameters of the balls.
	Balls with diameters 5, 4 and 2 will fall into the hole H3.
	Ball with diameter 1 will fall into the hole H2 since the hole H3 is already full.
	Ball with diameter 3 will fall into hole H2.
	Balls with diameters 6, and 8 will reach the bottom point B.
	The position of ball 20 is 1 because it is in hole H1.
	Positions of ball 15, 7, 10, 3, 6, and 8 are 0 because they reached the bottom point B.
	Therefore, the balls with diameter 5, 4 and 2 are in the 3rd hole H3, the ball with diameter 1 and 3 are in the 2nd hole H2.
	
	Input: H[] = {20, 15, 10, 5, 25}, B[] = {5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 4, 9, 14, 19}
	Output: 5 5 5 5 5 0 4 3 2 1
