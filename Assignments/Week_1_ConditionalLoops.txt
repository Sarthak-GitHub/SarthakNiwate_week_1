37. Given three numbers x, y and p, compute (xy) % p
Input:  x = 2, y = 3, p = 5
Output: 3
Explanation: 2^3 % 5 = 8 % 5 = 3.

Input:  x = 2, y = 5, p = 13
Output: 6
Explanation: 2^5 % 13 = 32 % 13 = 6.

Output : 24


Medium difficulty

39. Have the function ArithGeo(arr) take the array of numbers stored in arr and return the string "Arithmetic" if the sequence follows an arithmetic pattern or return "Geometric" if it follows a geometric pattern. If the sequence doesn't follow either pattern return -1. An arithmetic sequence is one where the difference between each of the numbers is consistent, where as in a geometric sequence, each term after the first is multiplied by some constant or common ratio. Arithmetic example: [2, 4, 6, 8] and Geometric example: [2, 6, 18, 54]. Negative numbers may be entered as parameters, 0 will not be entered, and no array will contain all the same elements.
Examples
Input: [5,10,15]
Output: Arithmetic

Input: [2,4,16,24]
Output: -1

40. Have the function FirstReverse(str) take the str parameter being passed and return the string in reversed order. For example: if the input string is "Hello World and Coders" then your program should return the string sredoC dna dlroW olleH.
Examples
Input: "coderbyte"
Output: etybredoc
Input: "I Love Code"
Output: edoC evoL I

41. Next Palindrome
Have the function NextPalindrome(num) take the num parameter being passed and return the next largest palindromic number. The input can be any positive integer. For example: if num is 24, then your program should return 33 because that is the next largest number that is a palindrome.
Examples
Input: 2
Output: 3
Input: 180
Output: 181
